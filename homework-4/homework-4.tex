\subsection*{Chapter 4 Connectivity and Paths}
\subsection*{Section 4.1 Cuts and Connectivity}
\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.1
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    (a) A graph is \(k\)-connected if its connectivity is at least \(k\).
    If a graph \(G\) is 2-connected, then its connectivity is at least 2.
    Given \(G\) has connectivity 4 so we have \(\kappa(G)=4\geq2\) which is
    true.
    The statement ``Every graph with connectivity 4 is 2-connected." is
    true. \\
    (b) A 3-connected graph \(G\) has connectivity at least 3 so
    \(\kappa(G)\geq3\).
    Consider the graph \(K_5\), we know that \(\kappa(G)\leq\delta(G)\) so
    \(\kappa(K_5)\leq4\).
    We know that \(\kappa(K_n)=n-1\) so we get that \(\kappa(K_5)=4>3\).
    This is a counterexample since \(K_5\) is 3-connected but it has
    connectivity 4.
    The statement ``Every 3-connected graph has connectivity 3.'' is false. \\
    (c) A graph is \(k\)-edge-connected if every disconnecting set has at
    least \(k\) edges.
    Consider a \(k\)-connected graph \(G\), we know that
    \(\kappa(G)\leq\kappa'(G)\) from Whitney's theorem.
    We can deduce that \[k \leq \kappa(G) \leq \kappa'(G) \]
    The edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\) is the minimum size of a
    disconnecting set and it is at least \(k\) so \(G\) is
    \(k\)-edge-connected.
    The statement ``Every \(k\)-connected graph is \(k\)-edge-connected.'' is
    true. \\
    (d) Consider a \(k\)-edge-connected graph \(G\) with connectivity
    \(\kappa(G)\) and \\ edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\).
    We have \(\kappa(G)\leq\kappa'(G)\) and \(k\leq\kappa'(G)\).
    If \(k>\kappa(G)\), then we have \[\kappa(G)<k\leq\kappa'(G)\] and
    Whitney's theorem still holds so \(G\) is not \(k\)-connected. \\
    The statement ``Every \(k\)-edge-connected graph is \(k\)-connected.'' is
    false.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.4
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    It is proved a graph \(G\) is \(k\)-connected if \(G+K_r\) is
    \(k+r\)-connected.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.8(b)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Let \(G\) be the graph on the right, we see that \(G\) is a 4-regular
    graph so the minimum degree of \(G\) is 4.
    Since every vertex is connected to four other vertices,
    we must remove 4 incidental edges of any vertex at minimum to disconnect
    the graph.
    Similarly, we must remove 4 adjacent vertices of any vertex at minimum to
    disconnect the graph.
    Therefore, the edge-connectivity of \(G\) is 4 and the connectivity of
    \(G\) is 4.
    The connectivity \(\kappa(G)\), edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\), and the
    minimum degree \(\delta(G)\) are
    \[\kappa(G) = \kappa'(G) = \delta(G) = 4\] which follows immediately from
    Whitney's theorem.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.11
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    It is proved that \(\kappa'(G)=\kappa(G)\) when \(G\) is a simple graph
    with \(\Delta(G)\leq3\).
\end{solution}

\subsection*{Chapter 5 Coloring of Graphs}
\subsection*{Section 5.1 Vertex Coloring and Upper Bounds}
\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.1.14
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    We can use the same color to color the vertices in the maximum independent
    set.
    Then we can use different colors to color the rest of the vertices.
    Therefore, we get a proper color of the graph.
    It is proved that for every graph \(G\), \(\chi(G) \leq n(G)-\alpha(G)+1\)
    is true.
\end{solution}

\subsection*{Section 5.2 Structure of \(k\)-chromatic Graphs}
\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.2.1
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Suppose \(G\) is not a complete graph such that
    \(\chi(G-x-y) = \chi(G)-2\).
    Let \(x,y\) be two non-adjacent vertices so we can color them with the
    same color.
    It follows that \[\chi(G) = \chi(G-x-y)+1\] which implies that
    \[\chi(G-x-y) = \chi(G)-1\]
    Hence, there is a contradiction thus every pair of distinct vertices in
    \(G\) must be adjacent which implies that \(G\) is a complete graph.
    Therefore, if \(\chi(G-x-y) = \chi(G)-2\), then \(G\) is a complete graph.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.2.22
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    
\end{solution}

\subsection*{Section 5.3 Enumerative Aspects}
\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.3.3
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    It is obvious that if \(k=2\), then we have
    \[k^4-4k^3+3k^2 = (2)^4-4(2)^3+3(2)^2 = 16-32+12 = -4\]
    The polynomial cannot count the proper 2-colorings of any graph.
    Therefore, it is proved that \(k^4-4k^3+3k^2\) is not a chromatic
    polynomial.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.3.4(a)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    We can use mathematical induction to prove that the formula is true.
    The least vertices a simple cycle has is 3.
    If \(n=3\), then \(\chi(C_3;k)=k(k-1)(k-2)=k^3-3k^2+2k\) by counting the
    number of ways to choose the proper color of each vertex.
    The polynomial gives \((k-1)^3+(-1)^3(k-1)=k^3-3k^2+2k\) when \(n=3\) so
    it is true.
    For every \(n\geq3\), assume that \(\chi(C_n;k) = (k-1)^n+(-1)^n(k-1)\) is
    true.
    If we remove an edge from a cycle of \(n\) vertices, then we get a path of
    \(n\) vertices.
    If we contract an edge from a cycle of \(n\) vertices, then we get a cycle
    of \(n-1\) vertices.
    The chromatic recurrence gives \(\chi(G;k)=\chi(G-e;k)-\chi(G\cdot e;k)\)
    and the chromatic polynomial of a tree \(T\) with \(n\) vertices is
    \(\chi(T;k)=k(k-1)^{n-1}\).
    The chromatic polynomial of \(C_{n+1}\) is
    \begin{align*}
        \chi(C_{n+1};k) &= \chi(C_{n+1}-e;k) - \chi(C_{n+1}\cdot e;k)
        = \chi(P_{n+1};k) - \chi(C_{n};k) \\
        &= k(k-1)^{(n+1)-1} - [(k-1)^n+(-1)^n(k-1)] \\
        &= k(k-1)^n - (k-1)^n + (-1)^{n+1}(k-1) \\
        &= (k-1)(k-1)^n + (-1)^{n+1}(k-1) \\
        &= (k-1)^{n+1} + (-1)^{n+1}(k-1)
    \end{align*}
    which implies that the formula is true.
    It is proved that \(\chi(C_n;k) = (k-1)^n+(-1)^n(k-1)\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.3.5
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 5.3.11
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    The sum of the coefficients of a chromatic polynomial implies that \(k=1\)
    so the sum is the number of proper colorings with exactly one color which
    must be 0 if the graph has edges.
    It is proved that the sum of the coefficients of \(\chi(G;k)\) is 0 unless
    \(G\) has no edges.
\end{solution}
