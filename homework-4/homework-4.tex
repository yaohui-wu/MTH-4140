\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.1
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    (a) A graph is \(k\)-vertex-connected if its vertex-connectivity is at least \(k\).
    If a graph \(G\) is 2-connected, then its vertex-connectivity is at least 2.
    Given \(G\) has vertex-connectivity 4 so we have \(\kappa(G)=4\geq2\) which is true.
    The statement ``Every graph with connectivity 4 is 2-connected." is true. \\
    (b) A 3-connected graph \(G\) has vertex-connectivity at least 3 so \(\kappa(G)\geq3\).
    Consider the graph \(K_5\), we know that \(\kappa(G)\leq\delta(G)\) so \(\kappa(K_5)\leq4\).
    We know that \(\kappa(K_n)=n-1\) so we get that \(\kappa(K_5)=4>3\).
    This is a counterexample since \(K_5\) is 3-connected but it has vertex-connectivity 4.
    The statement ``Every 3-connected graph has connectivity 3.'' is false. \\
    (c) A graph is \(k\)-edge-connected if every disconnecting set has at least \(k\) edges.
    Consider a \(k\)-vertex-connected graph \(G\), we know that \(\kappa(G)\leq\kappa'(G)\) from Whitney's theorem.
    We can deduce that \[k \leq \kappa(G) \leq \kappa'(G) \]
    The edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\) is the minimum size of a disconnecting set and it is at least \(k\) so \(G\) is \(k\)-edge-connected.
    The statement ``Every \(k\)-connected graph is \(k\)-edge-connected.'' is true. \\
    (d) Consider a \(k\)-edge-connected graph \(G\) with vertex-connectivity \(\kappa(G)\) and \\ edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\).
    We have \(\kappa(G)\leq\kappa'(G)\) and \(k\leq\kappa'(G)\).
    If \(k>\kappa(G)\), then we have \[\kappa(G)<k\leq\kappa'(G)\] and Whitney's theorem still holds so \(G\) is not \(k\)-vertex-connected. \\
    The statement ``Every \(k\)-edge-connected graph is \(k\)-connected.'' is false.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Excercise 4.1.8(b)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Let \(G\) be the graph on the right, we see that \(G\) is a 4-regular graph so its minimum degree is 4.
    Since every vertex is connected to four other vertices, we must remove all four incidental edges of an arbitrary vertex to disconnect the graph.
    Therefore, the edge-connectivity of \(G\) is 4.
    Similarly, we must remove all four adjacent vertices of an arbitrary vertex to disconnect the graph.
    Therefore, the vertex-connectivity is 4.
    The vertex-connectivity \(\kappa(G)\), edge-connectivity \(\kappa'(G)\), and the minimum degree \(\delta(G)\) is
    \[\kappa(G) = \kappa'(G) = \delta(G) = 4\] which follows immediately from Whitney's theorem.
