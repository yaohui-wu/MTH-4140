\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 5}
\begin{solution}
    We can choose a vertex \(v\) in \(2^k\) ways then we choose two of its
    neighbors in \(\binom{k}{2}\) ways to form a \(P_3\). There is four \(P_3
    \) for every \(C_4\) since we can choose an edge in a \(C_4\) to remove
    then we get a \(P_3\). The number of copies of \(P_3\) is \(\binom{k}{2}2^
    k\) and the number of copies of \(C_4\) is \(\frac{\binom{k}{2}2^k}{4}=
    \binom{k}{2}2^{k-2}\) in \(Q_k\).

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 8}
\begin{solution}
    We apply the Havel-Hakimi algorithm then we have
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item \((5,5,4,3,2,2,2,1)\implies(4,3,2,1,1,2,1)\implies(4,3,2,2,1,1,1
        )\implies(2,1,1,0,1,1) \\ \implies(2,1,1,1,1,0)\implies(0,0,1,1,0)
        \implies(1,1,0,0,0)\implies(0,0,0,0)\)
        \item \((5,5,4,4,2,2,1,1)\implies(4,3,3,1,1,1,1)\implies(2,2,0,0,1,1)
        \implies(2,2,1,1,0,0)\implies(1,0,1,0,0)\implies(1,1,0,0,0)\implies(0,
        0,0,0)\)
        \item \((5,5,5,3,2,2,1,1)\implies(4,4,2,1,1,1,1)\implies(3,1,0,0,1,1)
        \implies(3,1,1,1,0,0)\implies(0,0,0,0,0)\)
        \item \((5,5,5,4,2,1,1,1)\implies(4,4,3,1,0,1,1)\implies(4,4,3,1,1,1,0
        )\ \\ implies(3,2,0,0,1,0)\implies(3,2,1,0,0,0)\implies(1,0,-1,0,0)\)
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, it is proved that \((5,5,4,3,2,2,2,1),(5,5,4,4,2,2,1,1),(5,5,5,3
    ,2,2,1,1)\) \\ are graphic sequences but \((5,5,5,4,2,1,1,1)\)  is not a
    graphic sequence.
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 9}
\begin{solution}
    Let \(G\) be a graph of 26 vertices from two sets of 13 vertices s.t. the
    vertices represent the teams, the sets represent the divisions, and there
    is an edge between two vertices if two teams play against each other. Let
    \(H\) be a subgraph of \(G\) with 13 vertices in the same set s.t. it
    represent 13 teams in the same division. Suppose the proposition is true,
    each of the 13 vertices in \(H\) will have degree \(9\). Then the sum of
    the degrees in \(H\) must be \(13\cdot9\) which must be odd. However, the
    handshaking lemma states that for a graph \(G=(V,E)\) we have \(\sum_{deg
    (v)\in V}=2|E|\), i.e. the sum of the degrees is twice the number of edges
    which must be even. There is a contradiction and the proposition is false,
    that which was to be demonstrated. Therefore, it is proved that for a
    league with two divisions of 13 teams each, it is impossible to schedule a
    season with each team playing nine games against teams within its division
    and four games against teams in the other division.
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 4}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 18}
\begin{solution}
    Suppose the proposition is true for the sake of contradiction. Let \(G\)
    be a \(k\)-regular bipartite graph that has a cut edge \(e\) s.t. \(G-e\)
    is not connected. Let \(A\) and \(B\) be the two independent sets of
    vertices in \(G\). We remove \(e\) from \(G\) then \(G-e\) becomes a
    disjoint union of 2 bipartite graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\). The endpoints of
    \(e\) are the vertex \(u\in A\) in \(G_1\) and the vertex \(v\in B\) in
    \(G_2\). \(G_1\) has \(a\) vertices with \(a-1\) vertices having degree
    \(k\) and the vertex \(u\) having degree \(k-1\) in \(A\). \(G_1\) also
    has \(b\) vertices with degree \(k\) in \(B\). Then we have
    \begin{align*}
        e(G_1)=(a-1)k+(k-1) &= b\cdot k \\ a\cdot k-k+k-1 &= b\cdot k \\ a
        \cdot k-1 &= b\cdot k \\ (a-b)k &= 1
    \end{align*}
    Since we are given that \(k\geq2\) so we have \((a-b)k\neq1\) hence there
    is a contradicition and the proposition is false. Therefore, it is proved
    that for \(k\geq2\), a \(k\)-regular bipartite graph has no cut-edge.
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 5}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 45}
\begin{solution}
    The KÅ‘nig's theorem states that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has
    no odd cycles. Let \(G\) be the Petersen graph, we proved that \(G\) has
    12 \(C_5\) and every edge of \(G\) belongs to 4 \(C_5\). Thus in order to
    remove 12 \(C_5\) from \(G\), we have to remove at least \(\frac{12}{4}=3
    \) edges. Since \(G\) has 15 edges hence we will have at most \(15-3=12\)
    edges in the bipartite subgraph of \(G\) after we removed all of the odd
    cycles. Therefore, it is proved that the maximum number of edges in a
    bipartite subgraph of the Petersen graph is 12.
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 6}
\subsection*{Section 1.3 Problem 61}
\begin{solution}
    Let \((d_1,d_2,\dots,d_{n(G)})\) be the degree sequence of the graph \(G\)
    with \(n(G)\) vertices. Then the degree sequence of \(\overline{G}\) is \(
    (n-1-d_{n(G)},\dots,n(G)-1-d_2,n(G)-1-d_1)\). Since \(G\cong\overline{G}\)
    then the two degree sequences of \(G\) and \(\overline{G}\) are exactly
    the same. Thus we have \[(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_{n(G)})=(n(G)-1-d_{n(G)},\dots,
    n(G)-1-d_2,n(G)-1-d_1)\] Given that \(n(G)\equiv1\pmod4\) hence we have
    that \(n(G)\) is an odd number. Consider the middle elements in both
    degree sequences, they are equal thus we have
    \begin{align*}
        d_{\frac{n(G)+1}{2}} &= n(G)-1-d_{\frac{n(G)+1}{2}} \\ 2\cdot
        d_{\frac{n(G)+1}{2}} &= n(G)-1 \\ d_{\frac{n(G)+1}{2}} &= 
        \frac{n(G)-1}{2}
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, it is proved that if \(G\cong\overline{G}\) and that \(n(G)
    \equiv1\pmod4\) then \(G\) has at least one vertex with degree
    \(\frac{n(G)-1}{2}\).
\end{solution}
